      <p>
        I really love what I do and consider it a creative passion. It&#39;s
        helped me build a great set of professional and personal skills such as
        having a very good eye for detail (pixel perfect), being able to balance
        creative designs whilst maintaining good usability, accurately and
        efficiently managing my time and I&#39;m also very easy to get along
        with.
      </p>

        I have had the chance to work in a wide range of industries, these
        include agencies, automotive, fashion, charity, large enterprises and
        start ups. This has allowed me to gain a deep familiarity with the full
        product life cycle in a range of different environments. I&#39;ve also
        been involved in architectural decisions, usability testing,
        wireframing, design mocking, prototyping and proof of concepts.

      <p>
        I&#39;m also very aware of the importance of accessability and how it
        impacts individuals, businesses and society. SEO and web performance
        also play a crucial aspect too, having built up a good knowledge of them
        all has enabled me to create easy to navigate and performant websites.
        Please feel free to run a lighthouse test on my portfolio, I&#39;m
        really happy with the scores but I&#39;m always seeking out ways of
        improving them.

        My experience so far has enabled me to lead front end teams by
        collaborating and managing both the business and development
        requirements whilst ensuring smooth user journeys and interfaces. I also
        enjoy mentoring and developing more junior developers through code
        reviews, tech meetings and knowledge/idea sharing.
